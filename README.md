# Comparative Evaluation of Advanced Machine Learning Models in Forecasting Environmental Patterns

This repository presents a high-expertise comparison of Prophet, LSTM, SVR, TCN, and Transformer for forecasting temperature, wind turbine SCADA, and air quality data. Using CRISP-DM, it ensures robust preprocessing, model tuning, and interpretability (SHAP, RMSE, SMAPE) for real-world applications. 

ðŸ“– Research Context & Contribution
This work systematically applies and evaluates five state-of-the-art machine learning architectures for environmental forecasting across three diverse real-world datasets (temperature, wind turbine performance, and air quality monitoring). The study integrates an academic-grade methodology, following the CRISP-DM framework, and establishes a reproducible benchmarking pipeline for forecasting in dynamic, high-dimensional environmental systems.

## Overview

This repository presents a rigorous comparative evaluation of advanced machine learning models for forecasting environmental parameters such as temperature, wind turbine performance, and air quality. The study systematically analyzes five state-of-the-art forecasting models:

Prophet â€“ Captures long-term seasonality via additive models.

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) â€“ Specialized in handling sequential and temporal dependencies.

- SVR (Support Vector Regression) â€“ Effective in capturing non-linear relationships.

- TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) â€“ Designed for hierarchical temporal patterns.

- Transformer â€“ Utilizes attention mechanisms to model multi-variable dependencies.

The project applies these models to three distinct datasets:

1. Temperature Dataset â€“ Hourly temperature observations from Central-West Brazil.

2. Wind Turbine Dataset â€“ SCADA data capturing wind turbine performance.

3. Air Quality Dataset â€“ Daily pollutant concentration levels across Indian regions.

By following a structured methodology based on the CRISP-DM framework, this work emphasizes reproducibility, robust evaluation metrics, and insightful model comparisons.
