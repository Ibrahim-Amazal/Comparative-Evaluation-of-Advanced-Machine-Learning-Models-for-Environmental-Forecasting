# Comparative-Evaluation-of-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Environmental-Forecasting
This repository presents a high-expertise comparison of Prophet, LSTM, SVR, TCN, and Transformer for forecasting temperature, wind turbine SCADA, and air quality data. Using CRISP-DM, it ensures robust preprocessing, model tuning, and interpretability (SHAP, RMSE, SMAPE) for real-world applications.
